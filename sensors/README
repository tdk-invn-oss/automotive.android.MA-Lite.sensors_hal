Android Sensors HAL
===================
This Sensors HAL is reusable for Linux as a shared library as well as for
Android.


Porting
=======
1. Copy this folder to the target Android source tree
   e.g. To hardware/invensense/sensors

2. Include Sensors HAL in a list of PRODUCT_PACKAGES
   e.g. In device/<your>/<product>/device.mk

3. Change access permissions for sysfs entries to allow to access by Sensor HAL
   e.g. In ueventd.common.rc

   The entries can be found at:
   (I2C) /sys/devices/*.i2c/i2c-*/*-*/iio:device*
   (SPI) /sys/devices/*.spi/spi_master/spi*/spi*.*/iio:device*


Test applications for Linux
===========================
There are 2 test applications for Linux under linux folder.

test-sensors-hal
================
This application utilizes Sensors HAL as a shared library to control and
stream sensor data.

test-sensors-sysfs
==================
This application does not require a shared library of HAL but directly accesses
sysfs entries to control the sensor.
